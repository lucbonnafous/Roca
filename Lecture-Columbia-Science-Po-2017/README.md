##  DataDriven development

Whether they are massive - big data - or more traditional (census, household surveys, administrative data, etc.), we are the witness of the explosion of the use of data for decision and policy making; first within the private sector then in the administration and lately at the crossroads between sectors and public affairs (e.g. Cambridge analytics, project google election, Facebook monitoring fake news etc.)

Algorithms now "make decisions" based on real time data. But these algorithms are mostly black boxes, parsing and computing data that are not open data (which providers have never been so centralized - GAFA, etc.). This raises societal and democratic challenges. 

Are we entereing a Post-StatistiK world? What seems obvisous today is that data and statistics production are no longer a State monoply. What are the promises and challenges of the data revolution ?

### 1. Introduction: The Open movement, from accountability to efficiency

- The open movement
- Towards more accountable States
- More efficient administration ?
- Towards new data partenerships with in the private sector?
- What about Development Assistance ?

Conclusion: data is about people
	- A new data ecostystem
	- A new power distribution
	- A new ethic
### 2. Data, the raw material of the digital revolution:
- "Traditional" sources of data:
	- Census and Survey data
	- Administrative data
	- Africa's Statisticall Tragedy
- Big Data: when it's raining information:
 	- Sensor data (Sat., IoT, Cell-phone)
 	- Social network data
   	- Use case: 
	    - vulnerability to flood using statellite imagery (use case: [Cloud to Street /AFD study](http://librairie.afd.fr/nt25-va-vunerability-flooding-senegal/))
- Big Data: big difficulty to get access to it
    - Privacy, security, business
    - About Data ethics
### 3. The Digital Humanitarian movement
- The history of the digital humanitarian movement
	- Haïti 2010
	- Crisis mapping ([Humanitarian OpenStreet Map](https://www.hotosm.org/))
- Official statistics & Big Data in emergency context
	- When saving time saves life, real time data matters
		- Early assessment use case:
				    - Using cell phone to monitor displacement (use case: [Flowminder 2015 EarthQuake in Nepal](http://www.flowminder.org/case-studies/nepal-earthquake-2015))		
		- Coordination of the emergency response ([UN-OCHA HDX](https://data.humdata.org/))

Conclusion: new tools, new skills and analytics strategy: AI everywhere ?

Part II. June the 2nd

## Workshop: Datavisulisation when statistics meets web & datascience (2h30)
This folder contains information and script for the dataviz workshop

For this workshop, we are going to use Python 3.4.3 and JavaScript.
I recommend installing [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-343) and a code editor (e.g. [Bracket](http://brackets.io/) or [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/fr/)) we are also going to use [https://jsfiddle.net/](https://jsfiddle.net/)

**Here the thematic this workshop will cover:**

**1. Basic instroduction: (1h30)**
-   using packages with R and Python (15 min)

- 	Introduction to SVG
-	JavaScript & dataviz
    + quick intro to [JavaScript](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
    + dataviz the example of [highchart](https://www.highcharts.com/) and [d3.js](https://d3js.org/)
   
**2. Getting real time data: the API revolution: (1h)**

- Introduction: what is an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) ?
    + Intro to [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON)
-  Example: Using [twitter API in python](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/url/www.stats4dev.com/Ipython/Where_on_earth_is_Helen.ipynb)
-  Use cases:
    + An application leveraging [World Bank API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/889392-api-documentation)
    + Buidling an [API based Velib'](https://developer.jcdecaux.com/#/opendata/vls?page=getstarted) application
